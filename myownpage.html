             <p>This meme (best used as a reaction to a comment) is funny because the reaction of a 5 year old is as expressive and honest as one can get. Something that in an adult may be hard to express. Therefore we can rely on this image.</p>

          <p>Day 18 of lockdown seems to be a little naive having been already 2 years into the pandemic. That's fine, since this image reflected an emotional state of back then. If 18 days does that to a person, imagine what 2 years did to the whole world.</p>
